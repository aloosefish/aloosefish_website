### Here are some personal projects I am interested in working on:

* The Weirdest Thing
  + Analyzing content tags for front-page news stories from major national newspapers in order to find the most unusual stories.
* Sans Swagger
  + Using a <neural network>[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to create a rap lyric generator
