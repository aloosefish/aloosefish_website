### Here are some personal projects I am interested in working on, in no particular order:

* The Weirdest Thing
  + Analyzing content tags for front-page news stories of major national newspapers to find the most unusual stories
  + See how or if the subject matter has changed over a period of several years
* Sans Swagger
  + Using a <neural network>[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) to create a rap lyric generator
* Segregation study
  + Using US Census data to rate tracts according to levels of ethnic and racial diversity
  + Create an interactive map to visualize findings
* Analysis of software terms of use
  + Automated to incorporate textual changes as they are made
* Analysis of minutes of public government meetings
  + Presenting analysis in a way that allows portions of it to be "plugged-in" to any type of public meeting
