## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=TRUE}

library(tidyverse)

data("starwars")

starwars %>%
  select(name, mass, height, species) %>%
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height / 100) ^ 2)) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(median_bmi = median(bmi)) %>%
  arrange(desc(median_bmi)) %>%
  # head(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(median_bmi, species)) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
